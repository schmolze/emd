Title: Earth Mover's Distance for Differential Analysis of Genomics Data
Description: The EMDomics algorithm is used to perform a supervised two-class
    analysis to measure the magnitude and statistical significance of observed
    continuous genomics data between two groups. Usually the data will be gene
    expression values from array-based or sequence-based experiments, but data
    from other types of experiments can also be analyzed (e.g. copy number
    variation). Traditional methods like Significance Analysis of Microarrays
    (SAM) and Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) use significance tests
    based on summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) of the two
    distributions. This approach lacks power to identify expression differences
    between groups that show high levels of intra-group heterogeneity. The Earth
    Mover's Distance (EMD) algorithm instead computes the "work" needed to
    transform one distribution into the other, thus providing a metric of the
    overall difference in shape between two distributions. Permutation of sample
    labels is used to generate q-values for the observed EMD scores.
