Title: Earth Mover's Distance for Differential Analysis of Genomics Data
Description: The algorithm is used to compare continuous genomics data between
    two groups. Usually the data will be gene expression values from
    array-based or sequence-based experiments, but data from other types of
    experiments can also be analyzed (e.g. copy number variation). Traditional
    methods like Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and Linear Models
    for Microarray Data (LIMMA) use significance tests based on summary
    statistics (mean and standard deviation) of the two distributions. This
    approach tends to give non-significant results if the two distributions are
    highly heterogeneous, which can be the case in many biological
    circumstances (e.g sensitive vs. resistant tumor samples). The Earth
    Mover's Distance (EMD) algorithm instead computes the "work" needed to
    transform one distribution into the other, thus capturing possibly valuable
    information relating to the overall difference in shape between two
    heterogeneous distributions. A permutation-based method is used to generate
    a q-value and interpret the significance of EMD scores.
